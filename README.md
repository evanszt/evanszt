### Welcome to my GitHub! Here are some of the projects that I've been working on:


<br>NurseShiftProgram - This is a program that prints a menu and displays different information about the nurse's schedule based off of user input</br>
<br>BinaryOperations - These two programs find if a number is a power of two both with and without the bitset library</br>
<br>DoublyLinkedList - Here you'll find a doubly linked list with some basic methods for adding and subtracting nodes from it</br>
<br>AddressBook - This program uses GUI elements to build a digital rolodex</br>
<br>PolynomialCalculator - Here I created a calculator that can do polynomial addition, subtraction, multiplication and can even find the derivative.</br>
